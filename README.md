# Red Hat Summit Connect Iberia 2023 - Connecting your productive applications and microservices at scale in a MultiCloud and MultiRegion environments session

Repository for the [Red Hat Summit Connect 2023 Iberia](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/connect/emea/madrid-2023?sc_cid=7013a000003SeT8AAK) for Connecting your productive applications and microservices at scale in a MultiCloud and MultiRegion environments session.

## Abstract

Easily and scalable connect your applications and microservices across multiple clouds and regions using Red Hat Cloud Services, Red Hat ACM Submariner, Red Hat Service Interconnect / Skupper, and of course GitOps! In several live demos, we will connect multiple microservices across various clouds and regions (AWS, Azure, GCP), deploying parts of the front-end on a hyperscaler and "magically" connecting it to the backend deployed and managed at scale in another cluster located in a different hyperscaler and region!
